# Hey, you. Can we build something together? üë∑‚öíÔ∏è

I am a self-taught web developer and currently focusing on continuous self-improvement in the hopes of becoming a better professional (and student) each day through gathering a substantial range of theoretical knowledge while applying it through a hands-on approach to learning, building projects that are both challenging and rewarding, and that allow me to have a better understanding of the inner workings of what it means to build practical ‚Äî and most importantly ‚Äî functional applications.
