# Welcome, friend 🫂

I'm glad to have you with me while I embark on this journey of learning and development. I have a passion for building and creating new things and I always strive to reach the best outcome possible. I'm also a firm believer that community and feedback are a creative's best friend, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together towards greatness ;) 

I am a self-taught web developer and currently focusing on continuous self-improvement in the hopes of becoming a better professional (and student) each day through gathering a substantial range of theoretical knowledge while applying it through a hands-on approach to learning, building projects that are both challenging and rewarding, that allow me to have a better understanding of the inner workings of what it means to build practical — and most importantly — functional applications.

Hope to hear from you in the near future. Stay curious! ✌️⭐
